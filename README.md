This is my assignment for a dynamic text area as instructed in https://drive.google.com/a/recongate.com/file/d/0B44JvAgVgFegSjVHbG1CZHBxNm8/view?usp=sharing

I did not add Storybook to the package, since I have never worked with it before and did not wish to spend valubale (weekend) time configuring the package for the first time.

Limiting the textarea height according to a maximum row count was not that difficult, and a very good tip was found easily on stackoverflow.com. Preventing The textarea from allowing input to exceed the textarea's maximum row was tricky and required quite a lot of trial and error and rerendering in the componentDidUpdate method.

Good luck to me,

and thank you for the oppertunity.

Sincerely,
